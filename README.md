Not only focusing on Frontend, I also learn about backend with stack such as [Express.js](https://expressjs.com), [Python](https://www.python.org) and currently learning [Golang](https://go.dev). ⚡️ 

> Sometimes I sleep, sometimes I sing. But most of the time manually vibe coding. 🤓

Fav movie genres: mystery, thriller, horror, and comedy.
